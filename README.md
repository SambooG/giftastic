making a page of gifs that can show a selection of 10 giphys per category. 

This page uses an API to call to Giphys page (developers.giphy.com) and return the appropriate result by the search.

The user is also able to add their own category which calls 10 of the giphys relevant to the search.

I loved the background, so I sacrificed the cleanness for a few small ads. It wouldn't be my first choice normally, but I was really feeling the image when I found it. it is from https://pngtree.com/free-backgrounds and credit was required to use it.
